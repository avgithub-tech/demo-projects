# Spring cloud function

- Promote the implementation of business logic via functions.

- Decouple the development lifecycle of business logic from any specific runtime target so that the same code can run as a web endpoint, a stream processor, or a task.

- Support a uniform programming model across serverless providers, as well as the ability to run standalone (locally or in a PaaS).

- Enable Spring Boot features (auto-configuration, dependency injection, metrics) on serverless providers.

- It abstracts away all of the transport details and infrastructure, allowing the developer to keep all the familiar tools and processes, and focus firmly on business logic.
